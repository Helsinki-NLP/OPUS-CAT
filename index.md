title: OPUS-CAT MT Engine and CAT plugins
---

OPUS-CAT MT Engine is a Windows-based machine translation system built on the [Marian NMT framework](https://marian-nmt.github.io/). OPUS-CAT MT Engine makes it possible to use a large selection of advanced neural machine translation models natively on Windows computers. The primary purpose of OPUS-CAT Engine is to provide professional translators local, secure, and confidential neural machine translation in computer-assisted translation tools (CAT tools), which are usually Windows-based. To that end, there are plugins available for two of the most popular CAT tools, SDL Trados Studio and memoQ (OPUS-CAT can also be used in the Wordfast CAT tool as a custom provider, and in Memsource and XTM by using a Chrome browser plugin). OPUS-CAT MT Engine provides pretrained MT models for a very wide selection of language pairs, courtesy of the OPUS MT ([listing of OPUS MT models](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/Opus-MT-train/tree/master/models) and Tatoeba-Challenge [listing of Tatoeba-Challenge models](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/Tatoeba-Challenge/tree/master/models) projects.
