Models can be assigned tags, which can be used to identify them and to provide more information about the special features of a model. Tags are primarily used with fine-tuned models, although base OPUS models (models installed from the OPUS model repository) can also be tagged. Whenever a model is fine-tuned, it is assigned an initial tag. This tag can be edited in the **Edit tags** tab of OPUS-CAT MT Engine, which can be accessed in the following way:
  - Select a model in the **Models** tab of OPUS-CAT MT Engine.
  - Click **Edit model tags** button on the right side of the **Models** tab.

In the **Edit tags** tab you can view the tags assigned to the model and delete them by clicking **Delete**. You can also add new tags by entering the new tag into the text box next to the **Add** button and then clicking the **Add** button.
