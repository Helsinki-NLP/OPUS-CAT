## Disabling the plugin confirmation pop-up in memoQ

Create a ClientDevConfig.xml file under ProgramData/MemoQ containing just the following code:

![247184907-7aafb1e5-f7da-4732-90a8-7a52c5140f25](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OPUS-CAT/assets/2298061/5086474a-6146-41e0-8875-d3732eeaf811)

Note: adding this file disables the confirmation pop-ups for all unsigned plugins, so use this method with caution.
