It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are you being treated?
I have a splendid idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom has promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't let anyone know where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That would take time.
Why aren't you going after him?
That's one of mine.
You seem to be cold.
I feel like walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Was I talking to you?
Did you like the bicycle?
He's a bread lover.
I felt like an idiot.
I'm not getting enough help from Tom.
I'm not going to take advantage of Tom.
Tom was overweight.
What does that mean for him?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've met only once.
Thank you for letting me speak with Tom.
Let's fire them.
What's it worth?
The water came up to our necks.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was looking at him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped pacing.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom isn't my father.
Tom is a neighbor.
Tom has left already.
It's probably still available.
You looked lovely.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is served between 7 and 9.
Tom came last week.
They were all scared.
I've been watching.
You picked a nice one.
Nudists regard nudity as normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.

That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.

Do you know who I'm talking about?

This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You guys are wrong.
Tom was productive.
Racists are dumb people.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever shot a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
She got the ticket in vain.
I don't want to turn myself in.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing?
Tom has no children.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch was guaranteed.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should've known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his telephone ringing.
Tom did what Mary told him to do.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for the position is very intense.
I'm a little worried about her.

Tom isn't good at pretending.
Tom said that he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom glanced down.
I love honey.
I need to confess something.
Alcohol influenced him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know jack.
Tom glanced around.
They're quite safe.
Tom blushed a little.
No one really cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would've said no.
I have to help him.
He criticizes everything.
You'll understand when the time comes.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit out his gum.
I really love your eldest sister.
Can you see that Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on the picnic with John.
Don't be fresh with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous! We are not descended from apes, we only have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there something in particular that you want to see?
What time do you usually eat lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting your job?
It took all evening.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks that he's too cool for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're sort of rude.
It sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop bad mouthing Tom.
What could go wrong?
When will I get to Boston?
Tom ate a late breakfast.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
Someone's in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom is obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm obese.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
I happen to like it here.
Did you do your best?

She has good handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.

Can people buy these?
He doesn't seem so well.
Hey, can I have that?

I'd better go, too.
Excuse me just a moment.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I am in London.
It won't be lonely here.
She asked me to take a look at it.
I think we'd better not go out in this storm.
It took me a long time to rid myself of all those ants.
Do we really want to eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you do it in reverse?
Tom and Mary were talking in French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Do you like singing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs whenever I have a cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you so you can understand it.
Everybody seeks happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom was horrible to me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat which still had the price tag attached.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't like Tom much, do you?
One must distinguish.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the papers said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him to.
Tom is obedient, almost submissive.
What page is Tom on?
Mike said that he would come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
A man cannot be made in a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run for it!
Is there a delivery charge?
I want a second helping.
Why are we meeting here?
Glass breaks easily.
Tom's bed's empty.
He has a bad heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think Iâ€™m going to be okay.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've put this off for far too long. You will finish it tonight!
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What is it with you and him?
Whatever you do, do it quickly.
I think I know how to find him.
We accept checks.
This newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You got one right.
Macedonian has four verbal moods: indicative, conditional, imperative, and renarrative.
They haven't left.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom started smiling.
Tom isn't very happy.
Could I talk to you, Tom?
These pants fit me well.
I don't have a gun.
I need authorization.
We're the champions.
You frightened Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't litter!
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked furious.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's exactly what got me in trouble in the first place.
What exactly happened to you?
How are you not sleeping?
I'm getting advice from them.
Tom began screaming.
This tooth has to have a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is large.
It's a game for children.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll return at 6:30.
Tom told me to get lost.
I was only gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
She made a fuss for no good reason.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Keep a low profile.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom is a doofus.
Who's on your list?
He had a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, pal.
Let me out of here.
I'm just glad it wasn't you who did this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
The girl saw it, too.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do that right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're up against.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I walk with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom is a big spender.
Tom is the only one who can answer that question.
One of Tom's complaints is the food.
Be careful not to step in the mud puddle.
They both coughed.
The train traversed a tunnel.
Tom is overemotional.
Mary hasn't washed the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are any meals included?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It'll be all right.
It's boiling in here.
That can't be her.
Today is the fatal day that they will attempt their escape.
Everyone went crazy.
People are beginning to notice Tom.

My answer is still yes.
I'm here looking for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why are you working for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was at home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom has gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Tom might be playing chess with Mary right now.
It looks as if you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you won't help him?
Tom's room is messy.
There are no survivors.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I slapped him.
Tom is with somebody.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do.

Turn around.

We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right to it.
Didn't you hear me call?
Let's take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back.
Remove the tourniquet.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
I thought you didn't want the reward.
Look at that smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're insincere.
Why can't you go now?
You learn to appreciate your health when you are ill.
Look at this shining star.
I don't know how to help him.
Strap yourselves in.
Make him confess!
I know none of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory sucks.
We're bankrupt.
Everyone knows that you hit Tom.
Can't you help me just a little bit?
I like this school.
Call if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the lights.
When does your passport need to be renewed?

You must not give up.
Didn't you get one?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize it all.
I don't quite know.
I initially hated it.
He got his sleeve caught.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know it yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Keep quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he didn't feel cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom is here to protect me.

I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you're going to have to release Tom.
How shameful!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Ask them to join us.
Where should I park?
Doesn't anyone care?
How's that your fault?
Tom took a drink from a bottle of wine.
I fell off my bike.
Come in and sit down.
