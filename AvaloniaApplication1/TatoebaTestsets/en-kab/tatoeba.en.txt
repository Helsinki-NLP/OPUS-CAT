Someone was here.
Somebody's here.
It's a disgrace.

Can you find it?
The artist Jean-Louis Aubert is apparently right to say: "If you have joy in yourself, you could more easily catch happiness." Thus, in all circumstances, the blessed will never be completely cut down; he will always keep some verve. This could be called resilience.

Start now.
Do you think we'll win?

Are you wounded?
When do you actually get off work?
Do you see the smile?
I have something to give you.

Can you call my mom, please?
How often do you have headaches?
You're not laying one finger on Tom's money.
