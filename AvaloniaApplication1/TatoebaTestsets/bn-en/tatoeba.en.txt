Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop screaming.
She doesn't like to leave anything unfinished.

I feel bad for him.
Have you ever done that?
What's the point in doing this?
What is the date today?
Good-bye!
She got angry.
I totally agree.
My father loves pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like apples.
Did you buy it today or yesterday?
Eat the bread!
What you said is not true.
They have two daughters.
Is there a discount for children?
Come here!
Everyone ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Watch Tom.
What's the price?
Don't look.
We agree.
Tom went outside.
Hi! How are you?
Tom certainly plays the guitar well.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll be back later.
Tom threatened Mary.
Don't open that.
Come in.
Tom is teaching me French.
Do you mind my sitting next to you?
Then there is a problem...
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
I just don't know what to say.
Yesterday was my seventeenth birthday.
Where would Tom go?
I'd like a luggage locker.
You must take this cough syrup.
Can you get a day off?
I'd like to change my ticket.
Tom is definitely not happy.
Eat anything you like.
They all screamed.
It's late.
Leave us.
I'm not thirsty.
I had a cat.
Don't stand.
What time does it open?
It's ours.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
May I look at your passport?
I'm at a loss for words.
How do you keep so calm?
Eat whatever you want.

Forget him.
I can't tell one twin from the other.
I'm reading your book.
Nothing happened.
He was speaking.
Can I eat?
Tom is taller than Mary.
The baby is screaming.
I always feel sleepy.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.
He spent the evening reading a book.
I've won.
Take my handkerchief.
I will not tolerate this.
Goodnight!
They all screamed.
Science has many branches.
No I'm not; you are!
Watch out for cyclists and pedestrians.
You are always complaining.
What for?
I'd like to open an account.

Hurry up, Tom.
The church bell is ringing.
Allow me to go.
I accepted his invitation.
They have twin daughters.
Do you have a car?
You are very brave.
Don't hurt me.
Do you have a bicycle?
The most important thing you can do now is to remain calm.
Where is the duty-free shop?
Look at Tom.
How many nights will you stay?
I go to school on foot.
My throat is a bit dry.
I have a new red car.
Call me.
Keep an eye on Tom.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
You're not the first person to tell me that.
She is eating.
Tom swims well.
Doesn't it work?
She doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Call me.
Do you have a car?
Do you eat meat?
Is there another way to get there?
Nobody here does that.
You're not paying attention.
Could you show Tom around?
Take it.
Please accept my sincere apologies.
Do you have anything to declare?
I don't understand you.
He eats nothing but fruit.
I accepted his invitation.
Is Tom all right?
You're doctors.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
What are you doing?
One language is not enough.
Don't move!
They yelled.
My father is always getting angry.
All Tom wants to do is fish.
He lives near here.
I like him.
That was important.
Tom kept his eyes closed.
Where are your things?
Tom squeezed the lemon.
How many people in your party?
You should sleep.
I want Tom brought here now.
He will be ten next April.

Do you have a bicycle?
You are always complaining.
Do you eat meat?
My joints ache.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Can you play the piano?
Look at Tom.
I got a call from Tom today.
My hobby is listening to music.
I want to buy pineapples.
What's your name, please?
Don't yell.
This river flows into the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you yelling?
I like to write songs in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Nice to see you again.
How do you expect me to do all this alone?
I saw him running.
I don't feel like eating now.
Control yourself.
I know Tom was a friend of yours.
Stop gossiping.
How many episodes of One Piece have you watched?
How can I get to the airport?
I need a doctor!
Tom's yelling.
I'm a little busy here, Tom.
He's eating lunch now.
I found his house easily.
I give you my word.
That is mine.
We'll win.
You can eat anything you want.
I can't find my luggage.
When does the train leave for Boston?
How deep?
I ran outside.
I don't care what he does.

What do you want to be when you grow up?
I accepted his invitation.
What's the meaning of that?
I saw Tom last night.
You didn't understand.
They all screamed.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Which tooth hurts?
The woman eats bread.
Tom wanted you to have this.
I've finished my work.
My father can fly an airplane.
Who doesn't want to win?

Is this book Tom's?
How tall you are!
It is midday.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy stamps?
I heard yelling.
Are you coming down?
I'm lazy.

You can stay as long as you like.
He's sleeping like a baby.
I didn't notice.
Do you eat meat?
I'd like a shave.
Don't stop here.
I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
I want your opinion.
It is important to remember who your friends are.
This material stretches easily.
Could you please repeat what you just said?
I totally agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He ran.
I lost your phone number.
Get lost!
Would you like to come fishing with us?
How old was he?
Tom is teaching me French.
It looked cheap.
Add more water.
I love to travel.
I shouldn't have logged off.
Why?
Tom is breathing heavily.
I know that we still love each other.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
What have you found?
Sit here.
The hospital is crowded.
She's asking how that's possible.
I told them to send me another ticket.
I don't believe it!
Tom'll speak.
She explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
Here is your bag.
Read this first.
How old is your father?
I found my mother busy ironing out some shirts.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not yelling.
What's the meaning of this word?
Wait outside.
Could you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I'm not denying that.
Puzzles are fun.
They need friends.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
Tom threatened Mary.
If he had taken his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Tom can read French.
Ask Tom.
Don't scream.
What is the next stop?

The door is open.
We're here.
Ask Alex.
My father is going to China.

Don't underestimate us.
I'll be back by midnight.
Come with me.
Step aside.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Where's the knife?
That was an evil bunny.
I prefer black.
I am counting on you.
Do you have any cough medicine?
I'm only kidding.
They screamed.
She's asking how that's possible.
I forgot to telephone him today.
I saw him wash the car.
Tom sighed.
She is younger than me.
How long have you been living in Boston?
How can I get to the station?

Look! There is a cat in the kitchen.
I'm a student.
My father is frank.
I think you both know Tom.
