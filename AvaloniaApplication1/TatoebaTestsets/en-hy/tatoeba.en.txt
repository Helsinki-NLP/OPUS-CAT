Tom reads to his daughter.
My computer is expensive.
Smoke appeared.
Tom worked at a hospital.
I remember.
Keep reading.
Keep going.
Stay focused.
Sit still.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Ask anyone.
Look closer.
Take cover!
We're still the best.
Stop fighting!
That worked.
Keep quiet.
Come inside.
Tom is clearly upset.
Tom flinched.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Tom inhaled.
Take command.
Tom doesn't want to be seen talking to you.
Everybody left.
Come home.
I still believe you cheated me.
All I want is a chance to say I'm sorry.
Drive carefully.
She disappeared.
Drive faster.
I don't want to go to school.
Be kind.
Hold it!
You're so intense.
I improvised.
Sit there.
How many years have you lived here?
Tom danced.
Never mind!
They lied.
Tom jumped.
My mother is at home.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Stay still.
Step back.
Of course.
How beautiful!
Do you think I should do this?
Unbelievable!
Nobody knows.
Put your gloves on.
What's your number?
Nice shot!
Tom didn't go into detail.
Look out!
Please stop.
Tom hesitated.
They laughed.
Keep this.
Tom sighed.
They vanished.
I can't stand to think about it.
Be punctual.
Are you going to go on holiday this year?
Come in.
Move over.
That aircraft company deals in freight only.
Tom drowned.
By the way, where are you from?
Tom told me he didn't take French in high school.
Sit tight.
Look here.
Get out.
Anybody home?
I'm sorry I took so long.
I punched Tom in the face.
I disagree.
Keep dancing.
Ignore Tom.
Tom waved.
I feel like sleeping all day.
Find Tom.
Tom gave Mary a ride home.
Women change the world.
Louder, please.
Tell her that I am sleeping.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
Everyone laughed.
She's afraid of the dark.
I'm not quite sure yet.
Fill the pot with water.
I don't know whether Tom is hungry or not.
Loosen it.
Someone coughed.
Stop that!
It was vague.
Do as I asked.
That won't change anything.
I don't understand that at all.
Keep practicing.
Taste this.
How thrilling!
Tom should've asked Mary for help.
Keep searching.
Keep walking.
Can you tell me who is coming tonight?
Enjoy yourself!
Sit still.
Be content.
I don't know why Tom didn't come and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
Stop reading.
Stay focused.
Get serious.
Drive safely.
Feel this.
It helps.
Wait here.
Stop reading.
I don't know whether Tom is hungry or not.
I believe that you will succeed.
Come over.
One day, you will understand.
Look away.
How interesting!
Please relax.
What kind of books does Tom read?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three campgrounds in this area.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow.
Continue digging.
Wonderful!
Get changed.
Coffee, please.
He speaks really well.
Please sit.
Look around.
Examine it.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Have you been listening to me?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
It is a bird.
All aboard!
Take everything.
Come over.
You tried.
Leave me.
The apple is on the table.
Tom is bragging about his new car.
Contracts have already been negotiated.
Say nothing.
Watch yourselves.
How can you not know?
Take command.
How curious!
They sweated.
Continue working.
Tom clapped.
I've always wanted to read that book.
Me, too.
Everybody laughed.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Forgive us.
It was terrific.
She walks.
Return immediately.
Wood floats.
Get out.
Loosen it.
Try again.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
What are you stopping for?
Shove over.
I didn't think you even liked Tom.
When do you shop?
They won.
My mother is at home.
Tom got killed in a freak accident.
Things changed.
I resigned.
When do you shop?
Tom recovered.
How does this thing work?
Help yourself.
Stop trying.
Follow him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be patient.
Leave it.
This is not important.
I stayed home for a week.
I began living by myself.
Hold this.
Kiss me.
We are opposed to war.
Tom hesitated to discuss the subject with Mary.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Be prepared.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Tom laughed.
Time flies.
We forgot.
I need to see Tom now.
Say hello.
They started hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
Keep cool.
Drive carefully.
Try this.
Anyone home?
Be reasonable.
Keep walking.
Don't wait for us.
Quit gambling.
Follow him.
I try.
Tom needs something.
Replace it.
When do you shop?
Come quick!
Come home.
Sit down!
Terrific!
Look again.
Who should we give it to?
Stand up!
Stay there.
I spoke to Tom last night.
Keep trying.
Can you stop yelling?
Stop reading.
They swam.
They called.
Tom doesn't pay much attention to how he dresses.
It happens.
We were up front.
Tom and Mary walked down the busy sidewalk.
I can't be late.
We survived.
We work together.
Lie still.
Say goodbye.
Let me do my work in peace.
Forgive us.
Keep dancing.
Keep warm.
Think again.
We forgot.
We failed.
Ladies first.
I am not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day, you will understand.
At that time a primitive people lived there.
Stop it.
Tom gloated.
Unbelievable!
Move quietly.
I see.
Tell me.
Look around.
Stop squabbling.
Tom has come to help us.
I fainted.
Grab that.
Stop them.
Start over.
Keep walking.
Tom closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
Sign this.
Defend yourself.
Stop apologizing.
Everything matters.
Be punctual.
Hang on!
Don't wait for us.
Stuff happens.
Everyone screamed.
Let's stop beating around the bush and cut to the chase.
Tom chuckled.
She brushed away the dust.
The temperature has fallen below zero this morning.
Did you think that I'd forgotten that?
Be yourself.
Be calm.
They waited.
Tell everybody.
Ask anybody.
What do you suggest I do?
Come in.
We learn by experience.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
Watch yourself.
They danced.
Start writing.
Get down!
Drop it!
They walked.
Just tell me why you're really here.
Look closely.
Tom blinked.
Shut up!
This is my choice.
Tom reads French better than I do.
Show me.
Tom fainted.
Grab this.
Tom fought.
Tom agrees.
Watch carefully.
This will be easy.
Well done!
Tom moaned.
Anybody hurt?
Stop pushing.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Sing along.
Ask Tom.
I promise.
Nobody answered.
Not bad.
Sleep tight.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom has never been to my house.
Step forward.
Stop lying.
You're entitled to your opinion.
It's great fun.
Take care.
Continue working.
Stop it.
Sure I can, although I can't really speak Shanghainese.
I contributed.
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be fair.
When did you tell me?
Be sensible.
Tom is a very private man.
Tom agreed.
We failed.
There is a tall man in the classroom.
I'll watch TV.
Wait beside the car for me!
Tom tried to speak French to the saleslady.
Even if we end up being late, it doesn't bother us.
Ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
How horrible!
You should know that I'm in love with Mary.
I disagree.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Come over.
Keep back.
Listen.
Does this sound stupid?
Tell me.
What's your name?
We remember.
Running as fast as I could, I was able to catch up with my friend.
We're going to have fun.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Settle down!
I waited.
Something changed.
Tom is a runaway.
We waited.
Wow!
Everybody knew.
Sleep tight.
This box contains five apples.
I disagree.
Tom begged us to be patient.
I believed that he had no right to do that.
Tom chuckled.
Ignore Tom.
That'll change nothing.
Nobody volunteered.
I should be able to do something about that.
Come in.
Ignore them.
Many of the workers had missing fingers.
Keep searching.
They cheered.
Keep paddling.
Can you speak French?
Watch us.
I can't take it any more.
Eat something.
Three months before Tom was to graduate from college, he died.
Tom kneeled.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home.
Study hard.
Join us.
Tom swims better than Mary does.
Turn right.
Get real!
Start again.
Everybody smiled.
I need to know how this happened.
Keep it.
Let us tell you why we came.
Thanks anyway.
Yes.
Tom is with his mother.
Stay away.
They disappeared.
She was in a hurry to go home.
Quiet down.
You can't make it without me.
Please come.
I deserve more.
Hand it to me.
Please continue.
You were supposed to wait.
Step aside.
It helps.
I need to see Tom now.
Forget him.
The weather is good today.
Do you know Tom's last name?
Stop crying.
Please sing.
Memorize this.
I have not yet learned whether he reached there or not.
You're so intense.
Tom disappeared.
Nobody came.
What are you stopping for?
Oh no!
Tom answered.
Wake up!
Tom called the neighbors.
Walk slowly.
See you at school.
Catch him.
Tom and Mary are the only ones still in the room.
Kiss me.
Examine this.
Exercise outdoors.
Keep moving.
Hurry up.
Smile.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Keep them.
I see.
Hurry up.
What are they waiting for?
Thanks.
Who cares?
Leave tomorrow.
Stand up!
Say please.
It stinks.
We try.
Tom can go hear Mary sing at that club whenever he wants to.
Tom liked Australia.
Take action.
The tree is green.
Quiet down.
Read this.
Be content.
It was vague.
Stay back.
Stay quiet.
I think I left something in the classroom.
One day, you will understand.
Do as I asked.
I panicked.
That works.
Stay sharp.
Do you know Tom's last name?
Tom cried.
Stop here.
Flowers bloom.
Stop lying.
Hand me the briefcase.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Get inside.
Tom wants a new car.
Hold this.
Somebody intervened.
Mary giggled.
Start singing.
Answer me.
That worked.
We forgot.
Oh, hush!
Step back.
Please sit.
Who cares?
