I can swim.
Tom's daughter married Mary's son.
I am sick.
Do they speak French in Canada?
Will Tom be going to French class?
I'll call him on Friday.
Put a stamp on the parcel and post it.
Where will we go afterwards?
I listened to a very beautiful song yesterday.
Get lost.
I'm too busy at work.
He stopped by Tom's chair.
Did Tom fall in love with Mary?
Welcome.
Happy birthday!
I remembered where I was born.
You weren't invited.
I ran away.
Weren’t they a long time in the town?
Which color do you prefer?
It's a beautiful day.
We're both students.
Thank you very much!
The fish was swimming in the water.
I'm having a very delicious meal at home.
Tom didn't want to leave at all.
I'm drinking the coffee.
I wonder what will happen.
Thank you!
Will you take that?
What is your favorite color?
This letter is to the old woman.
I'm very tired.
His letter made her angry.
"Was that the right thing to do?" "No."

Where would I be going? I won't tell you!
I'm eating an apple.
Thomas asked me, "Didn't Alice see Mary the day before yesterday?"
What is the difference between Malcolm and Mairy?
I hope that your family is fine, my friend.
He went abroad last year.
Why aren't you listening?
This hotel was very near the lake.
Tom saw enough.
Do you know where Tokyo Tower is?
Were you there?
I have made him angry.
Hello everyone!
Shit!
May I ask how old you are?
There is a small brown dog under that table.
Come without delay.
Who's going to do it?
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
I think it's silly that Tom is learning French.
Are you students?
I'm the one who's hungry.
Isn't the trip to Australia quite expensive?
I am waiting for the train.
I'm ill.
At the end of fifty-one years, Tom and Mary divorced.
I remember many things.
It's always been like that.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Karen is angry with me.
I am as tired as a dog.
I'd be happy to help you.
It was a good and interesting night.
We got to the station at six.
This makes her angry.
They were the ones who were hungry.
I have no idea what happened.
Are you meeting someone here?
What do you think?
There is nothing to be said.
Tom and Mary are talking to each other.
Tom doesn't have to go.
I will go to the restaurant at 7:30 pm.
Tom hasn't left Australia.
"Was the dog under the table?" "Yes."
What a day.
I am well.
I must go.
Tom had lots of fun at the party.
My mother didn't see the boy on the street.
It's Tom's house.
He passed away.
God created me.
There is good fire from this coal.
I saw a star today.
Tom would have enough.
Dire necessity forced us to leave.

I opened the box. It was empty.
My name's Ricardo.
Tom is going upstairs.

These are students.
I suppose you love her.
I'm eating.
Where's the bread?
I bought a car in Derry yesterday.
The weather is good.
Tom's working.
I was busy cooking.
She is a woman of noble birth.
Tom has children.
Is your mum at home?
Where are your silk gowns?
I think he was angry.
Shit.
Her book is red.
It's not possible.
There are a great many people in the park.
Thanks!
You can go now.
"What did you give her this year?" "Two frying pans."

I'm learning Scottish Gaelic.
He did the work without any difficulty.

I'm working as a carpenter.
He doesn't sing well.
I am boring.
"Were you the director of that charity?" "Yes."

Tom is a well-educated person.
"Who gave us this video?" "Tom did."
This TV show is growing on me, anyway.
Happy New Year!
Better safe than sorry.
What did you do with my book?
Tom really enjoyed the party.
I talked about music.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy bread.
Do you have a cellphone?
Tom can't sing.
You weren't tired.
I think it's silly that Tom didn't learn the language that everyone speaks.
You're very nice.
Goodbye!
It's not easy to put breeches on a cat.
How are you?
Tom promised that he would return soon.
Tom has two children.
Were you in the moor yesterday?
Tom wasn't drunk.
I've only had two or three drinks.

Wait a minute.
I would like you to add my name to your mailing list for the course.
Try it again.
That was on the news.

Why are you alone?
The extravagant poor will never be wealthy.
I have enough.
I was very tired.
I need a stamp.

I'm drinking water in the kitchen.
She had white shoes on.
I love you.
He was working at the office yesterday evening.
I'll try to answer this question if I may.
Do you remember us?

I don't agree.
I did some work in the garden.
Come on!
Can he speak English?
Milk is better than water.
When was Tom in danger?
Where was she going?
Tom will need a place to stay.
I'm telling the truth.
Do you have any news for me?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Aren’t they going to the ceilidh in the town?
We'd have to paint the blade of the sword in order to change the color.

He will return within 3 hours.
You were tired.
My son is working hard on the field right now.
Revenge today, mourning tomorrow.
Where are we going tonight?
The boat was under sail.
It was Sunday yesterday.
Don't go to sleep with the light on.
Were you at home yesterday?
Look at that house.
It's sunny just now.
Try it again.

I am really sorry to hear that.
Who owns this house?
The children were playing in the park.
I'll arrive on 23 May.
He has to go to England in the summer.
I saw it with my own eyes.
I am going to the shop.
Shut up and listen!
"Would you like whiskey or wine?" "I'll pass, thank you."
You need to go with Tom now.
There is some coal in the stream.
Were you tired?
He sat down to read a novel.
Who owns it?
What is your favourite colour?
The table in that room is very nice.
Tom will work.
What on Earth is that?
Tom has been studying French for three years.
I started to learn it seriously in October.
It is certainly a tasty delicacy. To all of you I say "bon appetit."

Sorry!
I provoked him.
Have you read this yet?
"Will the exam be difficult?" "It will be more difficult than the last one."

Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
We can catch the bus from this town.
Will you be working at the hotel tomorrow in the morning?

This is awesome.
If not now, when?
Glory lasts longer than life.
It's raining.
I am really glad to hear that you want to live in Scotland.
Does anyone know what happened?
What did Tom drink?
