He's studying biology with great enthusiasm.
I had trouble getting the door open.
I suspect that's not going to happen.
I won't complain about that.
Doctors use medical equipment.
Did Tom give any other instructions?
She asked me to throw her the ball.
I thought I'd be fine.
I don't think it was your fault.
Have you decided on a name yet for the baby?
He seems to have been rich before.
Water temperatures in the Baltic Sea exceeded 23° C in some places.
I can't smoke.
Tom never walks anywhere.
I can't do that tonight.
Kill me with words!
Tom probably won't be able to get home by himself.
I need a taxi!
Tom needs to relax.
This is not a fish.
María is reading all of Dostoevsky's works.
If you'd been there, we would've had a good time together.
Tom, she's your mother.
They were alone in the library.
I wonder whether it'll snow tomorrow.
Do you have a match?
Walk slowly.
Tom continued looking around.
Does anyone know how Tom will be going to Australia?
He is tall and handsome.
I don't think Tom's answer is wrong.
It can't be done alone.
He wrote her a letter.
Tom and Mary should probably tell John they're hungry.
Tom and Mary need to wait for John.
Tom is supposedly very wealthy.
I'm sorry I'm late. My alarm didn't go off.
I don't know who Tom plans on going to the zoo with.
Do you love your mother?
Tom is absolutely wrong.
I called Tom on his cell.
Tom isn't like us.
The swimmers are entering the water.
I'll have to go and see what I can do.
That's not butter. It's margarine.
Tom may not make it on time.
Tom and Mary wouldn't have let their own children do that.
Anne suddenly felt that if she had not yet won Anthony's liking she had, somehow or other, won his respect.
I know I can always count on you.
Tom spent time with Mary.
Tom is already getting dressed.
The girl looked at him too.
It's Thursday today.
I saw Tom in the mirror so I turned around and said hi.
She wants it.
Beware!
He knew where he put his pen.
They could've gone by themselves.
We'll tell them.
I try to travel with only one suitcase.
What fun we had yesterday!
Inhale.
Tom doesn't seem to be as relaxed as Mary seems to be.
Mary said she didn't know the answer.
I think I do need some glasses.
You don't have to sit with Tom.
I've been pretty busy.
Can you give me an example?
Tom went to visit his sister in Boston.
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
Sami isn't committing any crime.
Sami is studying.
How did you find a hair in the soup if I'm bald?
Would you like to contribute?
Tom and Mary don't have the ability to finish the job by themselves.
I teach French to my friends once a week.
I'm grateful you volunteered to help.
Sami open the book and started reading.
Sami named his cat Farid.
It's quite likely Tom will come.
The whole world was involved in the war.
Mary went back to her car to get her umbrella.
He fries the eggs in oil.
Tom and Mary saved all of the letters John sent them.
Sami was so skinny.
They don't use the table and chairs.
Tom made me swear not to say anything.
We want to go back to Australia.
Do Tom and Mary still do that every day?
Birds fly.
Mary just got her driver's license.
The girl is extremely tall.
It's going to be six dollars because it's international.
He is not clever but stupid.
Tom corrected what Mary had written.
I lived in this house in the past.
Food!
How did Tom know we were going to be here?
Sami is going home now.
I'd like to go there with you.
It's over nine thousand!
Enjoy!
We don't know what happened to Tom.
Ask Tom to clear away the dishes.
Almost.
Do you guys know each other?
How could you understand what I'm feeling?
I saw Tom's pictures.
I used to come to Boston about once a month.
Tom told me he'd never let me down.
Did he write anything in his diary yesterday?
I like Chinese food a lot.
I knew you'd fail your French test.
Did you fill out the questionnaire?
I don't like my brother climbing the mountains.
Understood?
Do you live near Tom?
She trusts her doctors.
Tom is happy again.
You'll do great.
I wish Tom and Mary were on our team.
I would like to ask for a translator.
Tom didn't tell Mary he didn't intend to do that.
I'm not sure Tom will do that.
Oh! Show me, please.
I haven't seen him since.
Where's the shovel?
I don't have enough money to pay all my bills this month.
Choose one from among these.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
I am too lazy to go there.
Do you have a girlfriend?
A variety of people gathered at the meeting.
You can't live like that.
Don't sit on the rocks.
The company, wholly owned by NTT, is doing well.
Tom is going to need more time.
Which do you like better, bananas or apples?
Sami is a Christian.
Sami is a teenager.
It is said that there is no life on Mars.
Tom scared us.
Tom couldn't understand what the purpose of the mission was.
It isn't true that Tom saw a monster.
It's snowing where Tom and Mary are.
Sami was beaten with a heavy belt.
I hope we made the right decision.
Tom is at home for the whole day.
We should do away with this regulation.
Sami turned around and asked Layla why she was following him.
The girl is extremely tall.
I like much money.
They saw a mouse.
Nature never breaks her own laws.
He was unable to hide his tears.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are really studying French.
Tom couldn't think of right words to say.
I could have helped.
I almost never eat breakfast.
Wait for us.
We're not taking questions.
They haven't yet admitted they did that.
Did you go shopping yesterday?
Why do we need to find her?
You're the only person I know who likes getting up early in the morning.
Tom and Mary aren't very hungry, are they?
Layla managed to crawl to the doorway.
Sami struck Layla in the neck.
From my position, I cannot see the tower.
When was the last time you used a ruler?
Quite a few books in my library are in French.
Tom is out riding his bicycle.
Tom is at home for the whole day.
Mary told Tom she'd eat lunch with John.
I want to know exactly what you did.
I think it's not worth the risk.
The swimming pool will be closed tomorrow.
It's out of your control.
What was Tom working on?
Tom is a believer.
I didn't kill my wife.
How are you?
How can I gain her trust?
I thought I'd be fine.
You know that I love all three of you.
Mary shut herself up in her bedroom.
You wouldn't do this if Tom and Mary were here.
Tom didn't know whether Mary could drive or not.
There is a hole right there.
I saw you with Tom last Monday.
I felt a sharp pain in the stomach.
I saw Tom take your keys.
I must get in.
Sami got on Layla's Facebook.
I found Mary.
This music suits my present mood.
Tom is going home now.
Put that down!
I can't answer the phone now.
Man's life is short.
I was feeling guilty.
It's warm here all year round.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
Nobody can beat Tom.
You aren't afraid of dying, are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary went to Australia.
I saw you on TV.
Goodnight.
Sami brushed his teeth.
Yes, of course.
I wanted to become a doctor.
What kept you up all night?
Tom took risks.
He wanted me to help him today.
You weren't in Australia last year, were you?
Shameful!
I don't think that you need to tell Tom that you're planning to do that.
Are you studying chemistry?
Kazu likes sports very much.
Who will eat the apple?
You just said that to me?
You're gonna make me furious!
Why don't you remember?
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to ask John for help.
Tom said that he didn't intend to do that anymore.
Give me another one.
Why don't you eat some vegetables?
I won't do that if Tom and Mary are going to do that.
You can't take it with you when you die.
Where did you do that yesterday?
Tell me your address.
Mary said she'd been offered $3,000.
You said you would give me an answer.
You had better not see her now.
Mornin'!
Mary makes her own bread.
Maybe it would've been better if I hadn't done it.
It's about 133 kilometers from London.
We've got three major problems that need to be solved.
Tom told me why it was a good idea to do that.
Tom seemed very interested in doing that.
I didn't show Tom anything.
He did it not once, but twice.
I don't use that kind of language.
Tom and Mary have said they intend to pay back all the money they owe.
You ought not do that.
My parents are going to love you.
No, I am not married.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I wasn't very busy today.
The students stood up one by one and introduced themselves.
I can't speak the Berber language, but someday I will speak it well.
Mary is on her way back home.
You should get back home the day after tomorrow.
Mary rewrote it.
Enter!
Tom nodded and left the room.
I'm plastered.
Tom asked Mary to sell him the guitar she'd inherited from her grandfather.
It isn't hard for everybody.
The weather bureau says it will rain tonight.
Dan should be ashamed of what he told me.
Tom couldn't do that by himself.
An artist is known by their work.
Does anyone here know where Tom and Mary live?
Tom and Mary consulted with their attorney.
Tell me how to use the washing machine.
Thanks for your help.
Tom is young, but he isn't innocent.
Tom worked as a waiter at one of the most popular restaurants in town.
Study!
How do you know Tom did that?
He sold me his old car.
Sami is gonna have nothing.
Boys are noisy and rude to girls.
Sami was watching what was going on.
How unlucky I am!
Tom was born rich.
I'm going to buy it.
Mary said that she wasn't happy here.
Get used to that.
He told me he wasn't sick anymore.
Here's my business card.
Tom has been on the wanted list for three years.
This is Tom's bicycle.
I didn't know Tom would be absent.
Tom put the tray down on the table.
My mom always says that she will visit me soon.
Greetings!
Tom would want us to go.
Tom and Mary are worried that something might happen to them.
They could've gone by themselves.
Yes.
Tom doesn't earn enough money to support his family.
The sky has become cloudy.
Vultures circled over the dead bodies.
They say that they're prepared to do that.
Three guesses where I was yesterday!
I've been seen.
Sami believes there is a god.
The meeting will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday.
Most of the time he arrives late.
She told me that she'd buy it.
The burglar got away.
Do you enjoy visiting museums?
Tom is really a good dancer.
How long do frogs live?
Tom thought that his parents were perfect.
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary.
Quick!
I know what's up.
Tom looks like he's prepared.
The house was pleasant to live in.
I knew you'd fail your French test.
Mary lent all the money she had on her to me.
I'm doing well, thank you.
Show us some results.
I won't tell them you said that.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
I didn't know what to do when Tom and Mary said they wouldn't help me.
Exactly!
Tom covered the table with the new tablecloth he'd just bought.
Thanks for your help.
I'm going to take a closer look.
What are you going to do now?
Tokyo has many ancient temples.
Don't distract me anymore.
Do you have a moment to talk about Tom?
I hope to see you again in October.
Tom told Mary he'd be ready to go in three minutes.
Absolutely!
He keeps surprising me.
Can't anyone else come?
All people are not gentle.
Can you count the stars?
Okay.
Tom has promised never to do that.
A chauffeur sat in front.
We have a simple philosophy.
I will make it clear for her, just in case.
This chair is too small.
They said they were much happier now.
Tom and Mary said that they'd been careful.
You ran into him earlier, didn't you?
I am living in Volgograd.
I think you're intelligent.
What is your major?
Ask her to come tomorrow.
Think!
Tom became quite wealthy.
You didn't recognize me?
This has nothing to do with Tom.
Tom hadn't been expecting that answer.
I doubt I’ll be successful this time.
I have more questions for you.
We took risks.
We never should've left early.
Didn't Mary tell you she'd do that?
Her computer is on her bed.
I am also unemployed.
Tom, you should go, too.
Gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies . . . or forget to say thank you . . . or pull anybody's hair.
I saw Tom leave.
We need to go to Boston to help Tom.
There is a portrait of Bob on the wall.
Tom should help Mary.
You must do that more carefully next time.
Two dogs guard the entrance.
Where was Tom yesterday?
I won't die.
Sami can hear that noise.
I thought that your parents liked me.
Tom doesn't think Mary is nervous.
Mary shot me.
Breathe!
Can we get started now?
Tom is smart enough to answer all the questions.
Can you speak Turkmen?
It had all been a very big mistake.
I didn't have a good time last Sunday.
I don't think this is the only way to do this.
Do you have any idea where I might find him?
Would you like a seat?
I've never seen Tom and Mary do that before.
Study!
I think that Tom is miserable.
I don't want to live in Australia for more than a year.
Sami was very Muslim.
That's not what Tom really needs to do.
The pen is the tongue of the soul.
Japanese cars are very popular.
Pay attention to the bikes.
They looked like they were in a hurry.
The economy of the island is dependent on the fishing industry.
She promised me she'd come early.
I will check it.
She can't speak English, much less French.
I don't want to end up like her.
I will tie a rope round your waist, so that I may be able to pull you up again when you call.
Tom and Mary smiled at the camera.
Tom is from the South.
Do you like apples?
Sami didn't want to talk about that.
Tom's wife is just as crazy as he is.
Fadil waited for Layla at home.
I don't think this is the first time Tom has tried doing that.
Tom is working in Australia.
Tom sells shoes.
Tom didn't know who to ask.
Tom ran into the house to get something to drink.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
I'm going to put on some music.
I don't know where Tom and Mary want to live.
I have been waiting for the bus for an hour.
He bragged about it.
What is it you want me to do?
Really?
I think that I need glasses.
Sami is a friend from the university.
Stars were twinkling in the sky.
Tom is very young. He's much younger than Mary.
I had some interesting experiences while I was traveling.
I wish to be a doctor.
Here's a short list.
Tom spent time in Australia.
Tom and Mary said that they had found their keys.
Tom is not as good-looking as Mary.
Everyone liked her.
May I borrow your bike?
I like slow paced movies.
Tom didn't know Mary had done that.
I used it when I was in China last summer.
Sami was talking to a camera.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help very much.
He said that he only did that once.
Tom, she's your mother.
Do Tom and Mary know how much you paid for this?
And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.
She has her kid with her.
Sami knows that Layla is not a bad person.
The worst solitude is to be destitute of sincere friendship.
"Does she have a dog?" "No, she doesn't."
Whatever.
Mary may have said that, but I don't think she did.
He was such a materialistic person.
I'm not Brazilian.
Good night. Sweet dreams.
How many animals do you have at home?
You'll start right now.
Mary is having fun, isn't she?
Will you come with me to the concert?
It has a hole in it.
I doubt that we'll be able to prove that.
Did you buy a car?
Let me hear your frank opinion.
I know that Tom can't speak French.
Mary said she's not making much money.
Bye-bye!
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
Tom said that Mary shouldn't tell John about what happened.
What would you do in my place?
Most of the time he arrives late.
All you have to do is give this to Tom.
What time do you usually go home?
Tom said that Mary wasn't crying.
I didn't let Tom answer Mary's questions.
Tom would do that if he had more time.
You knew me, didn't you?
I'm the one who got us into this mess.
Call a doctor immediately.
Tom is much closer to his mother than he is to his father.
Kneel!
She could get here if she wanted to.
I have to go to sleep.
He mostly talked about his trip.
He can't chew well, because he has a toothache now.
Right!
Have you ever been in Okinawa?
Better late than never.
Tom fell under Mary's spell.
Die!
He didn't understand me.
You have something to read.
I'm the one who built this house.
They grow up so fast.
Thank you for dancing with me.
He was beating his wife.
Shoot!
Tom, you should come, too.
Step forward and make room for others.
In the end, we obtained what we wanted.
Do you think Tom will pass his driving test?
The economy has entered a recession.
He was supposed to give it back to me last week.
I've already told this to the cops.
Tom and Mary said they weren't expecting John to do that.
One point.
Tom has a problem that he needs to solve.
The event starts at 3pm.
I live in Australia now, but I'm from New Zealand.
You've got ten minutes to pack your bags.
