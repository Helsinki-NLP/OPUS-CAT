You have to go get it.
Why are you at home?
He looks like my father.
Don't stop him.
I am new here.
I'm not about to stop.
We know what you're doing.
How's your father?
I know what they said.
Why don't we go somewhere together?
See you again.
Take a break.
I have no home to live in.
You'll make it.
I gave birth to my first child last year.
I'm sure I've seen him before somewhere.
You are a good person.
Where's your family?
It would've been better if you hadn't gone there.
I'm not hungry.
I'm a new student.
I've lost my keys.
We're not alone.
I want you to know that.
In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?
No one knew what to do.
This made me think of you.
I'm one of your students.
Why don't you study French?
It's not what you think.
I do want to see you.
I'm glad you are here.
When do you get up?
Does Tom know why?
Where is my watch?
We have no money.
Excuse me.
I don't need it.
I told my parents everything.
There is no other choice.
I know what I would do.
I know where she is.
It's very good.
The weather was not only cold, it was also damp.
I have lost my pencil.
When do you get up?
You can choose whichever color you like.
She spent all afternoon cooking.
They have no money.
You are a good mother.
Are you coming or not?
I want to cook for you.
Do you want to be rich?
I have a headache.
If you don't understand, ask.
This is my father.
That's what I want to know.
What don't I understand?
I do not think that he will come.
I don't understand it.
They say that he's very rich.
His speech was excellent.
I don't want to cook.
Don't do it again.
Apart from his parents, no one knows him well.
I have done it.
I don't think that he will come.
He is in love with her.
The sun rises in the east.
Why are you not doing it?
It's going to be great.
There are no problems.
I still remember the first time.
Do you want to take that?
What's her name again?
I'm sorry I said that.
My brother is not at home.
My parents call me up every day.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
Look at this photo.
I'm in the car.
What are you good at?
Is that your mom?
Why is the sky blue?
If you don't understand, ask.
This is our car.
No one here has a car.
Vote for us!
I don't know that word.
You know me.
I am glad you are here.
Are you looking for us?
Forget it!
What is this thing used for?
I'm not proud of this.
My daughter will get married in June.
I know those women.
I understand what you're saying.
That makes me happy.
How do you know my name?
Do you want it or not?
Is this love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are the twelve months of the year.
I have a question.
I heard you got married.
Are you going or not?
She used to be a teacher.
I'm in love with her.
Goodbye!
What do you take me for?
I saw that, too.
You'll want to see this.
A promise is a debt.
She doesn't live with him.
I don't like those people.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you happy?
Without a doubt!
Nobody listens.
I thought that was your job.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
You aren't coming, are you?
Here he comes.
Give it to him.
I don't know how long.
Whose handbag is this?
May I come again?
Shut up!
Nobody knows what to do.
Don't look down.
I'll ask him.
We're back.
I'll be watching you.
I know things about you.
There is no problem.
I want to study French.
My car has broken down.
You know that I love you.
I know her.
Listen!
I know what I would do.
I know what's happening.
She's lost her car key.
Why aren't you with me?
May I see that again?
Can you tell a sheep from a goat?
You don't know my brother.
I'm taking you to school.
Do I know Tom?
Does that satisfy you?
May I come again?
That's why I like you.
Are you home?
It'll be hot.
Could I have the bill, please?
It is Monday.
It is too hot.
You know that I like you.
That bed is very comfortable.
Our trip is dependent on the weather.
I took the money.
What do you want to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you new?
I know what to do.
Do you like to study?
Do you have my money?
I don't know how.
I know how to do it.
Where're the shoes?
I'm glad you're here.
This is a very good book.
Thank you for stopping by.
I respect you.
I'm very sorry.
She's strong.
Here's $5.
I ran to my mother.
It's perfect.
Your trousers are dirty.
I'm watching you.
Thank you for stopping by.
Do you like studying?
I will give it to you.
Have a drink with me.
I want one, too.
You are my friend.
Where's our car?
No one knows what to do.
What school do you go to?
You don't want to know it!
He is a good student.
It made me think.
Take a book and read it.
I don't have a home.
Thanks a lot!
I know you said that.
I'm thinking about you.
He is happy.
I am hungry.
You do not know me.
Don't look at me like that.
I thought that you'd gone home.
My daughter will get married in June.
She was brought up by her grandmother.
I've given up on you.
I wanna go home.
They don't know about it.
I have an older brother.
I made that dress by myself.
How long do you want it for?
I leave home before eight o'clock every morning.
I've lost my glasses.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We understand.
I love that book.
Please read the text below.
You're the woman I love.
I will make you happy.
That's one of ours.
Where is your family?
Don't say that word again.
OK, I'll order it.
Where do we go?
I don't see how.
You know where I'll be.
What's the purpose of your trip?
We are happy to see you.
I know the girl.
Stop the car.
I don't see how.
Do you know what to do?
We know you.
No, thank you.
Where do you want to live?
I like where I live.
Don't ask.
Do I have to open the window?
Only a few drops of rain have fallen.
Where are you going?
You look very happy.
You have to go home.
Does she live here?
Are you learning French?
You'll be very sorry.
Come to visit me.
Where is my car?
I don't know how.
I saw my sister there.
I know what I'm doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I'm doing it for you.
That girl looks like a boy.
I don't have a brother.
It's a shame, my best friend is moving. He's going to live in another city.
Do they live with you?
You know that I have to go.
Here is your book.
It is not my day.
How long has she been sick?
If he had stayed at home that day, he would not have met with disaster.
Not only does she speak English, but also German.
I'm not in love with you.
I know what's going on.
I know you know this.
This is good, isn't it?
I know what you are thinking.
You've got a fever.
The skirt didn't fit so I had to alter it.
It would have been better if you had not gone there.
That girl looks boyish.
I love watching you cook.
I've got to fix my hair.
Is it too small?
It belongs to my brother.
I'm happy you're happy.
Would you have time to help me with something?
Give it to her.
I'm not good with names.
Do you know what love is?
The wedding will take place on Saturday.
If I don't eat, I will die.
Tell me about your plan.
Whose book is this on the desk?
I've lost my pencil.
Thanks for coming.
I'm a cook.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I cut class.
Take a good look at this.
Do you see it?
Are they looking at us?
Are you a good dancer?
After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath.
Is your mother here?
We came to see you.
They're children.
Come on, Tom. Don't be shy.
Don't forget to send the letter.
I know you like me.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
I go to school here, too.
I don't have a sister.
I cut my finger with a knife.
What are you looking at?
I'll make you happy.
Do you know where she is?
Where is your father?
Don't ask me again.
My father is home.
The skirt is too wide for me.
Are they Japanese?
Give me the book.
You're a good person.
These windows look to the south.
I forgot to buy bread.
I'll go on Sunday.
I don't see you.
Where do you come from?
We're here because of you.
I don't know where he lives.
There were a hundred people in the hall.
I understand it.
Turtles don't have teeth.
I'm not happy about it.
My dream has come true.
You can understand me.
I don't know what to say...
Do you know where he is?
I am not a student.
Let me see.
Are you home?
Be kind to those who hate you.
It isn't the same without you.
It's too small.
The elevator isn't working today.
We're very happy.
That girl is good-looking.
Come to visit me.
I'm not a very good carpenter.
You don't know me.
Tell them what happened.
I thought that you went home.
I did it for you.
I like your car.
Who's your teacher?
Are you going home?
Does that satisfy you?
That's enough.
Without a doubt!
Am I in love?
I don't know him.
I am glad you are here.
I need a hug.
I've given up on you.
Don't change sentences that are correct. You can, instead, submit natural-sounding alternative translations.
I don't know what to think.
I don't know what to do.
What makes people do that?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
The money is gone.
I'd like to rent a car.
I want to go, too.
It doesn't look good.
Where's your watch?
We've said our goodbyes.
Shut the fuck up!
I have lost my keys.
I don't understand this word.
I didn't know you were going to be here today.
I'm looking for you.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
I like your car.
They say he is very rich.
Nobody knows this.
Are you going or not?
I'm not coming with you.
There was a church here once.
I know that you said that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why don't you go home?
Is that what you think, too?
I'm not proud of it.
What do you want to watch?
Why do you ask?
There he comes.
I don't care as long as you are happy.
I hope you're doing well.
Take what you want.
I know that girl.
It's not broken.
You're a good mother.
Do you want a car?
I don't have money.
Do your homework.
I want to go with you.
I only know him by name.
She looks like her mother.
I will make you happy.
We're getting it.
How is the family doing?
I speak a little Spanish.
Go ahead.
How old is he?
I have to know why.
You're not my brother.
My family is small.
Does Tom know why?
Is your mother at home?
I like maths.
I know how to do this.
It's not the same without you.
Nothing happened.
See you later!
Hi.
Where's Tom?
Don't be shy.
Where do you know that from?
I'm not good at French.
When do you go?
They don't have any money.
Tell them what happened.
Whose phone number is this?
I don't cook.
This isn't French.
Don't look at me.
It's going to happen sooner or later.
They saw me.
Is everything arranged for the trip?
I didn't know that you were going to be here today.
He shook his head.
Are you at home?
It's not a thing one can well boast of.
Come on up here.
I love this car.
I know what to watch for.
Your o's look like a's.
How much does it cost?
Get it out of here.
I said get out!
Where do you wanna live?
Look at him.
No one listens to me.
Don't forget to post the letter.
We're here because of you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take your shoes off.
They know us.
What time do you get up?
I'm not about to stop.
I come from England.
I'm sorry that I said that.
Don't make me say it.
The windows are open.
You don't have to come.
No one is listening.
I never forget a face.
I don't think that he'll come.
There's no problem.
This is how to cook rice.
I know how to do it.
Nobody asked you.
They want us to do it.
What do you see out there?
I knew you'd be happy.
I'm not going to look.
Where is Tom?
Is this French?
Those are my sister's books.
From tomorrow on we can go to work together.
We have arrived.
I'm studying French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they're going.
This book is excellent.
Our horses are tired.
I know your father.
I learn French at school.
You have to go home.
Where did everybody go?
Can you open the window?
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
Where's my mom?
Not now, then when?
Are you looking for this?
Where's your car?
My father isn't home.
No worries.
Do you know something about this?
I'm not in love with you.
Are you looking for this?
No rich people live here.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
You know her.
I'd like to see her.
